# Project Title
**Udacity Intro to Self Driving Cars Nanodegree Project**

Built a classification pipeline that takes in an image of a traffic and outputs a label that classifies the image as a: red, green, or yellow traffic light.

Project had 2 criterias to pass :
1. **More than 90% accuracy**
2. **Never misclassify red lights as green**

I achieved 95.62% accuracy.

You can find all the necessary files inside **home** directory.
I had fun playing around with the dataset. Looking forward to working on similar projects in the future.
